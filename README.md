# üéì Skill Certification DApp

## Overview
The **Skill Certification DApp** is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to upload, verify, and manage skill certifications securely using **Blockchain Technology**.  
It leverages the **Ethereum blockchain** for tamper-proof verification, **MetaMask** for wallet integration, and stores certification details on-chain.  
Built with **React.js (Vite)**, **Solidity**, and **CSS**, this project ensures trust, transparency, and security in validating skills and credentials.

## üìã Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)  
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) (Browser Extension)  
- Ethereum Testnet (Sepolia recommended, with test ETH)  
- Hardhat / Remix IDE for smart contract deployment

## ‚ö° Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/skill-certification-dapp.git
cd skill-certification-dapp
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables   

Create a .env file in the root folder and add:
```bash
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
VITE_CONTRACT_ABI=your_contract_abi_json
```

Replace your_deployed_contract_address with the contract address after deployment.

Replace your_contract_abi_json with the ABI JSON from your smart contract.

### 4. Deploy Smart Contract

Write/compile your Solidity contract in Remix IDE or Hardhat.

Deploy it to the Sepolia Testnet (or Ganache for local testing).

Copy the contract address and ABI ‚Üí paste into .env as shown above.

### 5. Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```


Open your browser at:
```bash
http://localhost:5173
